- **Containers**: These containers will be deployed for running Ghost. We have two containers, one for Ghost and the other for MySQL. We are setting the environment variables returned from the MariaDB Acorn service for the Ghost container.
- **Services**: Acorn services are external services your application can utilize. In this case, we use the [MariaDB Acorn service](https://github.com/acorn-io/mariadb/pkgs/container/mariadb).
